    <string name="about_details">Charlottesville Artfinder\'s purpose is to improve the accessibility to the arts in Charlottesville, 
        Virginia. This app was created within the context of the Tom Tom\'s Tomtoberfest \"Apps That Matter\" competition, which is 
        sponsored by WillowTree Apps, a leader in the industry located on the downtown mall in Charlottesville. Within the competition, 
        HooApps, a student-run club at the University of Virginia, partnered with Piedmont Council for the Arts (PCA) to create an app to 
        support PCA\'s mission by empowering them with a presence in the mobile industry. The data that populates the app is owned and 
        managed by PCA.</string>
        
	<string name="about_pca">
        Piedmont Council for the Arts (PCA) is the designated arts agency of Charlottesville and Albemarle. PCA encourages community-wide 
        access to and appreciation for the arts through programs and services for artists, arts organizations, and their audiences. 
        The PCA website provides the most comprehensive arts-related information in the area as we work to inform residents and visitors 
        about cultural resources and to showcase the Charlottesville region as an arts destination.</string>
